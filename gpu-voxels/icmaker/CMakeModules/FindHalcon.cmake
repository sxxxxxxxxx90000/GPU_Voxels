# Try to find Halcon.  Once done, this will define:
#  Halcon_FOUND:          System has Halcon
#  Halcon_INCLUDE_DIRS:   The '-I' preprocessor flags (w/o the '-I')
#  Halcon_LIBRARY_DIRS:   The paths of the libraries (w/o the '-L')
# Variables defined if pkg-config was employed:
#  Halcon_DEFINITIONS:    Preprocessor definitions.
#  Halcon_LIBRARIES:      only the libraries (w/o the '-l')
#  Halcon_LDFLAGS:        all required linker flags
#  Halcon_LDFLAGS_OTHER:  all other linker flags
#  Halcon_CFLAGS:         all required cflags
#  Halcon_CFLAGS_OTHER:   the other compiler flags
#  Halcon_VERSION:        version of the module
#  Halcon_PREFIX:         prefix-directory of the module
#  Halcon_INCLUDEDIR:     include-dir of the module
#  Halcon_LIBDIR:         lib-dir of the module
